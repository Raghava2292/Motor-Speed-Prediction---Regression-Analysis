    "# Introduction\n",
    "The next step after doing the EDA is to use the cleaned data for model building. The data will be used to train the model and this trained model can be used to predict the motor speed. Since this is a continuous variable problem the **regression** techniques will be used here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression suggests that the model will train itself with the independent variables and make a regression equation or model. Then this model will predict the motor speed. This predicted value will then be compared with the actual motor speed value to get some error and performance measures. These measures will tell us how good the model is performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of regression techniques:\n",
    "1. Multi-linear regression\n",
    "2. Decision tree regression\n",
    "3. KNN regression\n",
    "4. Random forest regression\n",
    "5. Bagging ensemble technique\n",
    "6. AdaBoost technique\n",
    "7. Gradient boosting technique\n",
    "8. Stacking models technique\n",
    "9. Cross validation technique with above models\n",
    "10. Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three techniques are the basic techniques. The next five techniques are the ensemble techniques that would contain a number of these basic models stacked together and each model will run based on the output on the previous model. These are simply grouping techniques. All of these ensemble techniques make a group of same basic model except for the stacking model in which we can stack together different basic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross validation techniques will make different folds of the data and run the training multiple times. Each time a different set of observations is used for training and testing based on the number of folds. This will allow to reduce any errors caused by improper splitting of data. But when the dataset size is very large like this one the cross validation will not show much difference from the regular techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final one is the neural networks in which the data is fed into the network and the network will be trained with these inputs. The training involves the changing of weights applied on the connections between neurons in one layer to another layer based on the error between the prediction and actual value that is back propagated in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also tune the hyperparameters in all these models in order to get the best possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model training here, I used the VIF dataset that contains the **u_d**, **u_q**, **i_d**, and **pm** as independent variables and the **motor_speed** as the target variable."
