# Motor-Speed-Prediction---Regression-Analysis
Introduction:-

This project is about buidling various regression models that will predict the speed of a permanent magnet synchronous motor with the help of some independent variables. The entire project is split into 3 parts-
1. EDA to understand the data and cleaning it.
2. Model building and evaluation
3. Deploying a site to make live predictions of the data.

All the files regarding these 3 parts are present here.
